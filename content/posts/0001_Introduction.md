# My name is George, and your ticket has been escalated to me for technical review. 

I'm George and this is my blog to keep track of personal projects and research, as well as some interesting things I come accross. I have a bit of a bad memory so having everything written down in one place helps me keep track of it all! 

I work as a customer support lead for Windows products at an audio software/hardware company. I'm also a habitual tinkerer and an avid reader of technical documentation and sci-fi so naturally my main area of interest is "audio" but I spend a decent amount of time exploring how technology work at all levels, embeded systems and the potential for technological disruption in general. 

I set this up using **Hugo** and **Github Pages**, so thats what we will talk about first.
