# My name is George, and your ticket has been escalated to me for technical review. 

I'm George and this is my tech blog to keep track of personal projects, research and interesting things I come accross. By day, I am Windows customer support lead for an audio software and hardware company and by night (and on my days off) a habitual tinkerer whose brain can't stop asking why. As an avid reader of technical documentation and sci-fi, my main areas of interest are exploring how technology work at all levels, how "systems" relate, software/hardware hybrid solutions and technological disruption in general. 

I'm studying Python automation, but I am always discovering new concepts and seeking ways to use new skills to tackle problems and projects. For example, MicroPython and RP2040 based microcontrollers have a good hold on my attention right now.

So anyways, I wanted to start a blog to document my various projects to help me remember the things I have worked on. It sounded like a good opportunity to figure out how to do it myself, so my next post will be about I set it all up using **Hugo** and **Github Pages**.
