I'm George and this is my blog to keep track of projects in my workshop and studio, as well as all the research that goes into the process. I have a bit of a bad memory so having everything written down in one place helps me keep track of it all! 
<!--more-->

I work as a customer support lead for Windows products at an audio software/hardware company. I've produced underground music for over a decade not limited to any genre. I have worked on hardcore punk, beat tapes, electronic music, industrial, noise to dark wave projects. I am listening to or working with audio from morning to night, every single day. It's a bit of an obsession.

In my free time I study python, automation, microcontrollers and embedded system development. I'm also of course a habitual tinkerer and an avid reader of technical documentation and sci-fi. My  main area of interest is audio but I spend a decent amount of time exploring how all different types of technology works, at all levels. Staying curious and informed about how the world around us works helps us use the tech to control the world around us, rather than have the world around us controlled by the tech. I believe for those of us privilidged with a technical aptitude, it is our responsibility to shed light where it is dark, becuase its much easier for people to be taken advantage of in the dark. So anyways, I made this blog just to keep track of stuff for myself but if the information here helps anyone else by existing, that'd be nice too.

So let's hop right in... I set this blog up using **Hugo** and **Github Pages**, so thats what we will talk about first. But before we can do that, we will have to become familiar with how **Git** works...
